1.operators <=>
There is also the special operator
<=> (spaceship) that compares both the operands and returns an integer instead of a
Boolean. When comparing a with b, the result will be less than 0 if a is less than b, 0 if
a equals b, and greater than 0 if a is greater than b.

2.equals & identical
equals == (type juggling)
identical === (without type juggling)
